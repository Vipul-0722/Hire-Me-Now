 1. With react native you can write a codebase which can run on both Android and IOS 
 2. ALlow you to use native componentes which make better components and more seamsless UX
 3. Hot reloading

 4. Advantages of expo
  You dont have to worry about configuring your dev envirnoment and native dependency
  expo offer inbuild api for nativation,gesture, camera , map  

  Expo Router is newly lauched 
  Expo router takes a different approach of handling the navigation by using file based routing system 

  Difference betw React and React native

  Instead of rendering the HTML elements , we'll rendering native mobile components

  RN components:
  1. <Text/> similar to <p/> or <h1/>  

  2. </View> used to create container of other component    
     similar to <div/> with some added functionality specific to mobile app
     used flexbox by default 
  
  3. <TouchableOpacity/> RN dont have button it have TouchableOpacity 

  function mybutton(props)=>{
    return (
        <TouchableOpacity onPress={props.onPress}>
           <Text>{props.label}</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
    )
  }

  4. <ActivityIndicator/> : used to show spinner

  5.  <Flatlist/> : used to rendering a long list items that need to scrolled efficiently 
       similar to map but has extrra feature :
         --> Optimized scroll performance 
         --> item separation


       Flatlist -> larger list
       map --> smaller list   

   6. <ScrollView/> : It like magic box that can hold multiple component and views, providing scrolling container for them
      similar to overflow: scroll in HTML

   7. <SafeAreaView/> : Provides safe zone to render content without covering device notch,statusbar , home indicator   



Starting:
npx create-expo-app@latest -e with-router

1. create 
    app folder
     - _layout.js
     - index.js

 npm i -g expo-cli
 expo-cli start --tunnel  (if npm start give error)
